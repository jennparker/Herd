# Herd
Make America Healthy Again

This project was developed during AngelHack Seattle Hackathon 2018. Herd is an android application that helps parents better protect their children by utilizing data visualization to educate them on vaccination rates in their community and help them take appropriate action based on real facts and statistics. Our goal is to help stop the spread of contagious diseases around the world. 
# Motivation
In December 2014, over 150 people contracted measles during an outbreak in Disneyland that lasted several months. The incident showed the severity of these kinds of diseases and the unfortunately reality of not vaccinating children. Recent incidents like this inspired our team to spend the hackathon coming up with a solution to this dreadful problem. Our approach was led by research that shows that outbreaks can be limited by something called “herd immunity”. This means that if enough people are vaccinated, it’s difficult for a disease to spread from host-to-host because the amount of vaccinated individuals protect the unvaccinated from infection.
